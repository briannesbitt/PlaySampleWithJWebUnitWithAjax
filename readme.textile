h1. Play framework sample application with JWebUnit and synchronous ajax

It was requested on the google groups to share a sample application showing how to make your ajax calls synchronous to enable more predictive testing using JWebUnit.  This removes the necessity of using a random Thread.sleep(X) to wait for the ajax call to be done.

Here is the "google group thread":https://groups.google.com/d/topic/play-framework/ut9DQ1numsA/discussion

h2. Try it out for yourself

bc. git clone git://github.com/briannesbitt/PlaySampleWithJWebUnitWithAjax.git
cd PlaySampleWithJWebUnitWithAjax
play autotest

You can also run @play test@ and then browse to @http://127.0.0.1:9000@ to try it or <code>http://127.0.0.1:9000/@tests</code> to run the tests manually.
